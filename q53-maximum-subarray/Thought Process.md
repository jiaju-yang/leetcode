# Brute Force

Calculate all the sums of intervals $(i,j)$

Time complexity: $O(n^3)$.

# DP

There are many repeated computations so we could use DP to avoid them. Use a 2-d array `sum[i][j]â€‹` to store the sum of interval $(i,j)$, where $i$ is from $0$ to $n-1$, and $j$ is from $i$ to $n-1$. When we compute the interval $(i, j)$, we could reuse `sum[i][j-1]`.

Subproblem:

```python
def sum(nums, i, j):
	return sum(nums, i, j-1) + nums[j]
```

Time complexity: $O(n^2)$

# Another DP

Three ways of defining the subproblem of DP in string: `(i,j)`, `(i, 0)`, `(0, i)`

Here, if we define the subproblem `(0, i)`, then we can get a better time complexity.

The trick is to define another problem recursively instead of the original problem recursively cause we cannot define the subproblem of the original problem in $O(1)$. Here the 'another' problem is 'the maximum sum of the suffixes of the array `nums[:j]`'.

```python
def max_suffix_sum(nums, i):
	return max(max_suffix_sum(nums, i-1) + nums[i], nums[i])
```

Time complexity: $O(n)$

# Divide And Conquer

The difficulty is how to define the subproblem if we wanna get the maximum continuous sum from subproblems in $O(1)$.

Time complexity: $T(n)=2T(\frac n2)+O(1) \implies O(n)$
